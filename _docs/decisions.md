2026-08-24 - SQLite is the oracle, not sqllogictest

The sqllogictest corpus builds its own tables with CREATE TABLE and
INSERT, which historian will never support. Running it would mean
building a storage engine to satisfy a test harness. Differential
testing against SQLite gives the same authority over the grammar we
actually support, on our own data, with no adapter.

2026-08-24 - Pushdown may only narrow to a superset; the filter stays

A scan that claims a predicate is exactly satisfied lets the filter
above it be removed, and every scan becomes a place where wrong rows
reach the user. Keeping the filter costs one pass over an already
small row set and confines pushdown bugs to performance. Removing
provably redundant filters is a v2 optimisation with its own tests.

2026-08-24 - blame is built first, before commits

Building commits first means two months of being a worse SQLite, and
teaches the scan the wrong interface: read everything, filter in
memory. blame cannot be materialised, so pushdown is a feasibility
requirement from the first commit and every later table inherits the
right scan shape.

2026-08-24 - blame shells out to git blame --line-porcelain

Rename detection and merge handling are a month of work in a domain
nobody is evaluating. The subject of this project is the engine above
the scan.

2026-08-24 - The spec lives in _docs/spec.md, undated

It was first written as a dated design document, which made it a
historical record - and historical records are never edited, while the
source of truth has to change whenever the project does. Splitting by
lifecycle instead: _docs/spec.md is living and always true,
_docs/decisions.md is append-only and never edited. The original path
also carried the name of the tooling used to write it, which is not
something this repo should know about.
